				About us &ndash; what is astronology?
			</h2>

			<p>
				Astronology is a system of logic that assumes celestial objects have no
				influence on human affairs or terrestrial events.
			</p>

			<p>
				We reject the tradition of assigning a star/zodiac sign to all humans at
				birth without their permission. We don’t think that it’s ‘just a bit of
				fun’. We deplore that astrology, a practice built on lies and quackery,
				is supported by mainstream media outlets.
			</p>

			<p class="justify-self-start">Our goals include:</p>

			<ul class="pl-4 list-disc list-outside">
				<li>Standing up for logical thinking and evidence-based science.</li>
				<li>
					Providing a forum for humans to publicly reject the pseudoscience of
					astrology.
				</li>
				<li>
					Encouraging more humans to explore astrology’s lack of logic and
					evidence.
				</li>
				<li>
					Highlighting the conflict of interest of those who peddle astrology
					myths for profit.
				</li>
			</ul>

					<ul class="pl-4 mt-1 list-disc list-outside">
						<li>
							Stick it to your monitor so Janice from accounts stops reading
							your horoscope out in the lunch room.
						</li>
						<li>
							Upload it to your dating app images to instantly filter out
							astrology believers.
						</li>
						<li>
							Post a copy to your uncle Neil (you know, the ‘spiritual’ one who
							weaves his own underwear from nettles), so he’ll know not to try
							and convert you to his ways on your next visit.
