				Yes this is a joke,<br />
				but weâ€™re very serious about it
			</h2>
			<p class="text-sm">
				Youâ€™re on our site so you must be a smart human. Therefore you know this
				is a joke.
			</p>
			<p class="text-sm">
				But just in case anyone is confused or thinks weâ€™re defrauding people â€“
				letâ€™s be very clear that this is not our intention. All paying members
				will get access to the various downloads on our Gumroad page. And weâ€™re
				also serious about the grant (see below).
			</p>
			<p class="text-sm">
				The idea for this Society came about because astrology really annoys us.
				And until some future time when we can use quantum nanotechnology to
				erase our star signs, this will have to do. If you feel the same as us,
				this tongue-in-cheek membership might be for you (or someone you know).
			</p>
			<p class="text-sm">
				From time to time, weâ€™ll put new downloads on our Gumroad page, which
				all paid members will be able to access for free, regardless of when
				they signed up. One day we also plan to offer some nice merch.
			</p>
			<p class="text-sm">
				But for now, weâ€™d love you to join us and become an eminent member of
				one of the worldâ€™s most logical societies â€“ sit back, relax and let us
				officially rescind your star sign! ðŸ˜‰
			</p>

				Grants
			</h2>
			<p class="text-sm">
				Our Society may be a bit of a joke, but weâ€™re keen to offer a little
				support to someone doing real science with stars and planets. After the
				end of each financial year (30 June), we will donate 25% of all profits
				from our membership fee (and any merch we sell in the future) to a
				scientific grant.
			</p>
			<p class="text-sm">
				The plan is that the inaugural grant will go to a female doing senior
				studies in astrophysics/&#8203;astronomy in Australia. Obviously we
				donâ€™t know how much it will be yet. It might be enough to buy some cool
				astrophotography equipment â€¦ or a round of thesis-celebration cocktails.
				We hope itâ€™s the former, but the latter sounds fun too.
			</p>
			<p class="text-sm">
				Full disclosure: weâ€™re regular folks who currently know nothing about
				how to give someone a grant. But weâ€™ll figure it out by EOFY and put the
				details up on this site and social media.
			</p>

				Privacy policy

			<p class="text-sm">
				Because weâ€™re regular folks just like you, we promise not to do things
				that would make you feel as if you shouldnâ€™t have trusted us.

				If you become a member of the Society, youâ€™ll buy your membership
				through Gumroad. They process your data, so if youâ€™re concerned about
				this sort of thing â€“ which you should be â€“ you should also check out
				<a
					class="underline"
					href="https://gumroad.com/privacy"
					style="color: rgb(2, 81, 88)"
					>their privacy policy</a
				>.
			</p>
			<p class="text-sm">
				We can see the details you provide in our Gumroad dashboard. Thatâ€™s the
				only place those details will ever be: weâ€™ll never export them, copy
				them, sell them, buy an enormous electronic billboard in Times Square to
				display them, or do anthing else with them.
			</p>
			<p class="text-sm">
				Once youâ€™re a member, we have no reason to email you. Thereâ€™s no mailing
				list. If you want to keep up with what weâ€™re doing, follow us on
				<a
					class="underline"
					href="https://twitter.com/astronological"
					style="color: rgb(2, 81, 88)"
					>Twitter</a

				or

			<p class="text-sm">
				The really astute of you may notice that our home page loads a number of
				items that your browser flags as â€˜trackersâ€™. These come as part of the
				Gumroad button. Thereâ€™s nothing we can do about these, and weâ€™ve turned
				off the optional third-party analytics services (Google and Facebook).
			</p>
			<p class="text-sm">
				We arenâ€™t tracking you. We donâ€™t care what you do or where youâ€™re doing
				it. Thatâ€™d be creepy.
