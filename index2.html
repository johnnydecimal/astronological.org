      <h2>About us – what is astronology?</h2>

      <p>
        Astronology is a system of logic that assumes celestial objects have no
        influence on human affairs or terrestrial events.
      </p>

      <p>
        We reject the tradition of assigning a star/zodiac sign to all humans at
        birth without their permission. We don’t think that it’s ‘just a bit of
        fun’. We deplore that astrology, a practice built on lies and quackery,
        is supported by mainstream media outlets.
      </p>

      <p class="justify-self-start">Our goals include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Standing up for logical thinking and evidence-based science.</li>
        <li>
          Providing a forum for humans to publicly reject the pseudoscience of
          astrology.
        </li>
        <li>
          Encouraging more humans to explore astrology’s lack of logic and
          evidence.
        </li>
        <li>
          Highlighting the conflict of interest of those who peddle astrology
          myths for profit.
        </li>
      </ul>
